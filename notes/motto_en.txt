Give a man a fish, and you'll feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he'll buy a funny hat. Talk to a hungry man about fish, and you're a consultant.

The quality of any advice anybody has to offer has to be judged against the quality of life they actually lead.
‚Äï Douglas Adams, The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide

Remember: when people tell you something‚Äôs wrong or doesn‚Äôt work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong.
‚Äï Neil Gaiman

Don't complain, gossip or judge

Try to stop complaining about life, discussing other people and judging them. Don't criticize your family and loved ones. If you see their mistakes, try to conduct the conversation calmly, without nerves or shouting. When this becomes a habit, your character will improve. And this will have a huge impact on positive changes in your life.	

Never ignore a person who cares for you. because someday you'll realize you've lose a diamond , while you were busy collecting stones üåõ	

Let me love you softly allow me to be the one not only in your dreams but in reality. Allow me to treat you and spoil you and give you all the things you need without you even saying a word. Allow me.	

ü•Ä¬∞‚Ä¢I will never change my personality to make someone love me, loving me is your choice and heating me is your decision.¬∞

The flowers never tell the sun how much they love her,but if she burned out, the whole earth would scream.
That is how I feel for you. If you left, my world would bend in half and never straighten out, and I wrote these words because I want you to know that I am the flowers and you are the sun. And I need you to know that you are not just rising and setting to kill time. You are not just living to get to the next sleep. You are lighting up so many skies and you don't even know it, you radiant, electric star. I am not asking you to stay for me; I'm begging you to stay for you. And for the flowers. And for tomorrow. And for all of the tomorrows after that. ‚ù§Ô∏è	

Let go of the past
Most of us have unpleasant situations from past years that we replay in our heads and emotionally relive over and over again. It's too much. The past cannot be changed, and there is no need to drag such a burden behind you. Imagine a problem from the past burning up in a fire, drowning in the ocean, or crumbling upon impact. Describe what happened on paper and burn it or actually drown it. Mentally, out loud, or in writing, forgive the offender or yourself.	

"Maybe in another lifetime."
No. This is all you get. So please, just fight for the things that crack  light into your life, fight for the things that soften you. Protect the people you love, leave them better than you found them. Defend your heart, do whatever it takes to keep it open despite what it has been through. Forgive, not just others, but yourself,as well. Slow down -- taste, and touch, and feel and care. Create the things you want to see in this world, stay as curious as possible. Honour your joy, do not shy away from the good that is trying to reach you -- do not convince yourself that you are unworthy of it. Be strong enough to be gentle. Be brave enough to break. Be all that you are. Be all that you are.

ü•ãü•ä Story On Bravery And Courage: 
One cowardly person came to a master of martial arts and asked to teach him bravery. The master looked at him and said: 
I will teach you only with one condition: one month you will have to live in a big city and tell every person that you meet on your way that you are a coward. You will have to say it loudly, openly and looking straight into the person‚Äôs eyes. 
The person got really sad, because this task seemed very scary to him. For a couple of days he was very sad and thoughtful, but to live with his cowardice was so unbearable that he travelled to the city to accomplish his mission. 
At first, when meeting the passers, he quailed, lost his speech and couldn‚Äôt contact anyone. But he needed to finish the master‚Äôs task, so he began to overcome himself. When he came up to his first passer to tell about his cowardice, it seemed to him that he would die from fear. But his voice sounded louder and more confident with every passing day. Suddenly came a moment, when the man caught himself thinking that he‚Äôs not scared anymore, and the further he continued doing the master‚Äôs task, the more convinced he was that the fear was abandoning him. That way a month had passed. The person came back to the master, bowed to him and said: 
Thank you, teacher. I finished your task. Now I‚Äôm not afraid anymore. But how did you know that this strange task will help me? 
The thing is that cowardice is only a habit. And by doing the things that scare us, we can destroy the stereotypes and come to a conclusion that you came to. And now you know that bravery ‚Äì is also a habit. And if you want to make bravery a part of yourself- you need to move forward into the fear. Then the fear will go away, and bravery will take its place.‚Äå‚Äå

You will not have to quiet the way you care, you will never feel like you are too much. You will not have to beg for the love you deserve. One day, you will be met where you are. One day, you will be someone's favorite thing, and you will not be confused, you will not feel like you are fighting for someone who isn't fighting for you. One day, you will understand that it never mattered how tightly you held on to the wrong people, how intensely you tried, because the right people were always going to find you. The right people were always going to stay.
